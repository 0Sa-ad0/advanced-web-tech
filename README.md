## NestJS & NextJS

### so, in this project i did it with NestJS & NextJS.

*15 APIs (Controller and Service), Pipes (Transformation and Validation), File upload, Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many), JWT Authentication, Bcrypt and Session, Exception Handling, Mailer (smtp)*
and test/run in [Postman API Platform](www.postman.com). 

#### For NextJS, i added these features...
*AXIOS HTTP Request (API calls from NestJS), React Core Concepts (Props, States, Hooks), NextJs Concepts (routes, rendering, Libraries), Vanilla JS Form Validation (No HTML Validation), Tailwind UI, Authentication*
and test/run Browser.

I used [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for Database.
