# ADVANCED WEB TECHNOLOGIES 
## NextJS

### So, in this project I did it with NextJS.

#### For NextJS, i added these features...
***AXIOS HTTP Request (API calls from NestJS), React Core Concepts (Props, States, Hooks), NextJs Concepts (routes, rendering, Libraries), Vanilla JS Form Validation (No HTML Validation), Tailwind UI, Authentication*** 
and test/run Browser.

I used [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for Database.
